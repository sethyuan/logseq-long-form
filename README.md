- Visual effects to clearly indicate block nesting relationships.
- Easy writing of ordered and unordered lists.

- Each block can have a meta block, where you can write anything you normally would not like to display.
- The best markdown export you can find on Logseq, better than the built-in one.
- An accurate word count that's not based on the markdown but what you actually see on the screen.
